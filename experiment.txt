datasets:
    postcvpr_supervise: only load one sequence and train on it using supervised learning
    postcvpr_sim_data: supervision is still physics-based, but the first frame is generated by PBS (marvelous designer)
    postcvpr_sim_sup: many sequences generated by PBS and train on them using supervised learning
